                I had answered 829 questions in Quora, then promptly scraped almost all those answers and created my own simple github page. I wanted to do more with what I have written. First among them is to create wordclouds.

                The word cloud creating algorithms provide unique solution to the problem of placing the words that are having different sizes and shapes. Jason Davies' blog about creating the word cloud is eye opening and his repo on d3.cloud() will be center of attraction in this notebook

                I decided to read through the "NLP with Compromise" notebook to understand how to use the Compromise cool library so I can implement it for creating word clouds for my answers. I will let you explore the numerous notebooks on compromise cool and jump directly into creating some function that get some interesting things out of the answers.            </p>
