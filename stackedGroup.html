    <h1>Collapsing the Stacks of Bars into Groups</h1>
    <p>Three actions will be taking place in this example. Stacked bar chart will be created, followed by
        creating the grouped bar chart and then transitioning between the two type of chart. There will be
        many interlocking components.Thinking of extending this example to include Histograms of the categories...
    </p>
    <h2>Transition has start and the end states, and a trigger that initiates it</h2>
    <p>
        The transition itself has not meaning without the starting and the ending. 
        The code has to tell that state.One issue I faced was using the "this.parentNode" 
        with arrow function "=>" doesn't work. 
    </p>
    <h2>Why the chart go above the frame?</h2>
    <p> Because the "y" attribute gets set to 0 or undefined value. In the svg the 0 is at the top of the 
        page. When the scales are computing these values, such issues always occur. Especially
    when you type the code.</p>
    <h2>Why color scheme schemeCategory20c is considered as null?</h2>
    <p>D3 library is continuously updated, so the recent ver 7.0 doesnt have this color scheme.
        In its place, many other other <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-scale-chromatic">color schemes</a>
        like schemeSet1, schemePaired, schemeAccent have been introduced. I have chosen the schemeTableau10
        for this visualisation.
    </p>
    <h2>What to do when the visuals don't appear</h2>
    <p>Debug by opening the Developer tools, and checking the elements.By looking
        at the elements, the kind of error can be easily understood. If there is no elements
        at all, then probably you did not include the .data(yourData) command in the selectAll
        method.
