                Points on a graph conveys magnitude through the position. In Force Directed graphs the positions are simulated 
                while the size of the point conveys the magnitude. Chandrasekaran is BIG. To find how big, just hovering your mouse 
                reveals the information

                Additional data points can be added to the circle using the colors, and other SVG shapes. It is truly possible to 
                use the Force Directed graph, Simple. No Axes, No Legends. <strong>Information is conveyed.</strong> 
                Idea to visualise the Bizheads is from <a href="https://vizheads.com/">VizHeads.</a> That project has lot more going 
                on. The headshots of Vizheads, their twitter handles and the size of the heads linked with the number of references. 
                It all starts with Force Directed Graph.

                Another inspiration is <a href="https://pudding.cool/2017/03/hamilton/">Pudding's Hamilton by Shirley Wu.</a> This 
                project is a massive effort and passion. We can see the information is shown without losing the emotion.
