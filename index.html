        Me and D3...
    </p>
    <p>
        Repo that hosts my list of projects on Data Visualisation, Java Script, CSS and HTML
    </p>
    <p>
        Fascination with charts that change at a click of mouse has been a driving force, culminating into this Repo.
        Central work will be implementing
        many of the charts and visuals in plain HTML using D3 and Javascript. Supporting libraries like Arquero, Vega
        also be used for adding data, and
        needed variety for the visualisation tasks, and goals.

        <h3>Vision</h3>
        <p>
            Build cool visuals and data explorations. In that process bring some insights on data wrangling, programming
            and bubble up the knowledge specific to the domain of the data being analysed.
            These charts and scales are built with HTML and CSS tags. Learning D3 is considered daunting since it works
            at the lowest possible level on the web page. Below that, is simply typing out the html tags by hand.
            Hosts of Libraries like the following has been built on top of D3 to ease the process of building the visuals.

        <h3>D3 programs the DOM.</h3>
        <p>
            Programming is about the details. To start programming the DOM,the details of the
            DOM needs to be understood at much deeper level.My learning wouldn't be possible without the resources on
            the internet. Especially
            the books and the youtube videos access I had. Following are some of the libraries, tools and books that
            influenced my learning till date.

        <h2>Climbing down the Visualisation Abstractions</h2>
        <p>
            It all begins with the tags. svg and html tags that build the visualisation which renders casually on the
            webpage. My visualisation climbs up this visualisation Abstraction ladder. Race car is made beautiful as the
            parts making it fit precisely and reliably. So is a visualisation. Both are work of engineering and
            creativity.

        <h2>Learning from the Master</h2>
        <p>Here I make the ugliest, and broken charts that I can think of. Why call it Ugly? Anything that you create when learning 
            is ugly. That simple. When I am learning from the creator of D3, the best way to learn is to take his examples and break it 
            creative ways. 
        </p>
        <p>What I will achieve?</p>
        <p>Deeper level Understanding of the tool and in the process find things that one should not do with D3. I have read some 15 books 
            on visualisation. They show the best visuals out there and teach to create them. I am learning here...join me. Lets make things 
            beautiful!!! Together.

        <h3> How to render the files Local machine </h3>
        <p>After cloning the repo, and changing directory (cd command) into the repo follow the steps below. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Install npm <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm">npm installer</a></li>
            <li>Check npm is up and running using npm -v command on your terminal (cmd/sh/ps)</li>
            <li>Install live-server using the command npm i -g live-server (-g flag for global installation)</li>
            <li>cd into the directory where the html and js files are located</li>
            <li>Type live-server in the terminal </li>
            <li>Webserver will open up with the Index.html file in the current directory </li>
            <li>In order to move between the file, check the Index.html file for the names of the html files </li>
            <li>Append the filename to the localhost:portName/"name".html in the address bar</li>
