    <p>
        Me and D3...
    </p>
    <p>
        Repo that hosts my list of projects on Data Visualisation, Java Script, CSS and HTML
    </p>
    <p>
        Fascination with charts that change at a click of mouse has been a driving force, culminating into this Repo.
        Central work will be implementing
        many of the charts and visuals in plain HTML using D3 and Javascript. Supporting libraries like Arquero, Vega
        also be used for adding data, and
        needed variety for the visualisation tasks, and goals.

        <h3>Vision</h3>
        <p>
            Build cool visuals and data explorations. In that process bring some insights on data wrangling, programming
            and bubble up the knowledge specific to the domain of the data being analysed.
            These charts and scales are built with HTML and CSS tags. Learning D3 is considered daunting since it works
            at the lowest possible level on the web page. Below that, is simply typing out the html tags by hand.
            Hosts of Libraries like the following has been built on top of D3 to ease the process of building the visuals.

        <h3>D3 programs the DOM.</h3>
        <p>
            Programming is about the details. To start programming the DOM,the details of the
            DOM needs to be understood at much deeper level.My learning wouldn't be possible without the resources on
            the internet. Especially
            the books and the youtube videos access I had. Following are some of the libraries, tools and books that
            influenced my learning till date.

        <h3>Climbing down the Visualisation Abstractions</h3>
        <p>
            It all begins with the tags. svg and html tags that build the visualisation which renders casually on the
            webpage. My visualisation climbs up this visualisation Abstraction ladder. Race car is made beautiful as the
            parts making it fit precisely and reliably. So is a visualisation. Both are work of engineering and
            creativity.

        <h3> How to render the files Local machine </h3>
        <p>After cloning the repo, and changing directory (cd command) into the repo follow the steps below. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Install npm</li>
            <li>Check npm is up and running using npm -v command on your terminal (cmd/sh/ps)</li>
            <li>Install live-server using the command npm i -g live-server (-g flag for global installation)</li>
            <li>cd into the directory where the html and js files are located</li>
            <li>Type live-server in the terminal </li>
            <li>Webserver with the files in the current directory will open up</li>
            <li>Open the HTML file that you want to view.</li>
        </ol>
