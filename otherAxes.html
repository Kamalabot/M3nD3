        <h1>The Scaling Challenge</h1>
        <p>There are many scales onto which the data can be mapped. On these scales the axes depends. Whether top or left the 
            axes needs tick marks and values. For that scales come in handy.</p>
        <p>
            If visualization is constructing “visual representations of abstract data to amplify cognition”, then perhaps
             the most important concept in D3 is the scale, which maps a dimension of abstract data to a visual variable.
                                                                                - Mike Bostock
        </p>
        <p> Learning to use the Scale effectively is more important than placing the points on the chart. I have decided to master the 
            scales first, followed by the ticks formating, then color scaling. All these are done practically to implement day to day 
            visualization at the beginner level.

            Here are the list of Problems faced and Solved?
        </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Locating the X-axis at the bottom of the SVG </li>
            <p>Issue here was the green rectangles were translated to the very bottom of the g element that was created. 
                When the x-axis was attached, it went out of the view. The solution was to bring up the SVG element and leave a 
            margin below. </p>
            <li>Formating the ticks of the time scales</li>
            <p>Formating is straight forward by using d3.format("%a"). Challenge arose in using the correct function to call the format.
                tickFormat(d3.format()) chaining to d3.axisBottom() turned out to be the correct way. D3's help was not clear in this regard
            </p> 
            <li>Positioning the Ordinal ticks along the X-axis</li>
            <p>Again the help for the Ordinal function was bit opaque, especially when it comes to assigning the range. 
                The range in other scales are [start, stop]. For ordinal [each ordinal point has seperate stop]. The solution is to create
                custom range using the map() function. 
            </p>
            <li>Automating the positioning of the SVGs on the page</li>
            <p>I wanted to automate the design of the webpage and make it beautiful and usable at the same. 
                D3 gives the necessary tools for shapes, colors while JS gives the looping abstraction necessary for populating
                the shapes and colors.
            </p>
        </ul>
        <p>The chart area will be colored green</p>
