    <h1>Collapsing the Stacks of Bars into Groups</h1>
    <p>Three actions will be taking place in this example. Stacked bar chart will be created, followed by
        creating the grouped bar chart and then transitioning between the two type of chart. There will be
        many interlocking components. Following blocks by Mike will be referred. Data for the chart is taken 
        cityPopulation.csv

    <p>Below is the list of D3 libraries used to implement the charts</p>
    <pre>
        d3-dsv - load and parse data
        d3-scale - x- and y-position, and color encoding
        d3-format - SI prefix formatting (e.g., “10M” for 10,000,000)
        d3-array - compute simple statistics (e.g., max)
        d3-axis - display axes
        d3-shape - computed stacked positions
    </pre>
    <p>One of the challenges I faced was having different styles needed across different charts that is created. The base style of the 
        page is imported through the style.css file outside the page. While the style specific to the charts and page are created using 
        the <!-- <style> --> tag.
    </p>
    <h3>How to wrangle the data as it is imported using d3.csv</h3>
    <pre>
        function wrangle(d, i, columns){
            console.log(d) //this is the entire row
            console.log(i) // index of the row
            console.log(columns) // columns headers are already seperated 
            for (i = 1, t = 0; i < columns.length; ++i){
                d[columns[i]] = +d[columns[i]] //converting the cell vals to numbers
                t += d[columns[i]]
                d.total = t
            }
            return d
        }    
        //bringing in the data
        d3.csv("cityPopulation.csv", wrangle).then((data) =>{
            console.log(data)
        })
    </pre>
    <p>The complex charts are created as layouts in D3. Stack chart is one such 
        complex chart. The rectangles has to be placed on top of the other, and 
        their size needs to be modified based on the scale. Following is the 
        main script part that makes the data ready for stacking.
    </p>
    <pre>
        .data(d3.stack().keys(keys)(data))
    </pre>
    <p>Two more notable commands were the following. They 
        show how important is to know the data structures
    </p>
    <pre>
        keys.slice().reverse() reversing the keys to append it to chart
        y(y.ticks().pop()) getting the top most value of the scale
    </pre>
