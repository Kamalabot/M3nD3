    <h1>Python Libraries for Data Science</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Libraries solve the problems that we face on daily basis. Every problem has many different solutions.
            Python libraries are the hallmark of such varied solutions, that has been implemented by different
            programmers
            all around the world.
            The internet is filled with cookbooks, reciepes and code snippets.
        </p>

        <h2>Python libraries Syntax</h2>
        <p>Single Page to Learn and understand what a library is about and its basic syntax followed by the link that
            takes you to the
            libraries main page.

        <h3>Cleaning the Data using Map function</h3>
        <pre>
            var decorData = data.map((frag) =>({
                title:frag.topic_head.replace("_", " ").replace("/",""),
                desc: (frag) =>{
                    let temp = frag.data.replace('['," ").replace(']',"");
                    return temp.split(',').join('\n')
                },  
                code: frag.code.replace('\n',"\r")
            }))
        </pre>
        <p>The above code using map function doesn't execute as intended. The aim is to clean the 
            description by removing the square brackets, and add the space.
        </p>
        <h3>Cleaning using the for-each loop</h3>
        <pre>
            function cleanData(dataPoint){
                dataPoint.code = dataPoint.code.replace(/(\r\n|\n|\r)/gm,"\r")
                dataPoint.topic_head = dataPoint.topic_head.replace("_", " ").replace("/","");
                let t = dataPoint.data.replace('['," ").replace(']',"");
                dataPoint.data = t.split(',').join('\n')
            }
        </pre>
        <p>The above function works in cleaning the data on the fly. The replace function for removing 
            the line breaks and carriage returns has to be regex 
        </p>
        <h3>Regex for removing the \n</h3>
        <pre>
            dataPoint.code
            .replace(/(\\n)/gm,"")
            .split(',')
            .join('\n')
        </pre>
        <p>Using the global and multiline modifier in the replace 
            function helped to remove the \n characters. Even then
            there are still remaining characters that are unwanted.
