    <h1>How the enter, update and exit works</h1>
    <div>
        <h3>Join API</h3>
        <p>The shape can enter the chart through enter and update functions, and the exit function removes the unncessary shapes.
            The below visual shows the same. There are many random points to begin with. 
            
            Once you click the The real data buttom, the number of lynx trapped Vs the Year data populates. It is only 20 points.
            As the transition begins on the circles, we can see the unwanted circles removed from the SVG. This is due to the usage 
            of join clause.
        </p>

    <div>
        <h3>Text was getting over written after every click of the button</h3>
        <p>Text data is populated using the the D3 select method, when the function is called by the button click. The number of text values 
            entering the context is same everytime. The join api cannot remove the nodes that it can bind to the data. Due to this, the 
            seperate remove() needs to be added

        <h3>Click the button and append</h3>
        <p>With the call back show, and d3.select appending the p element to body was straight forward</p>
