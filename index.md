Me and D3... 

Repo that hosts my list of projects on Data Visualisation, Java Script, CSS and HTML

Fascination with charts that change at a click of mouse has been a driving force, culminating into this Repo. Central work will be implementing 
many of the charts and visuals in plain HTML using D3 and Javascript. Supporting libraries like Arquero, Vega also be used for adding data, and 
needed variety for the visualisation tasks, and goals.

Vision is to build cool visuals and data explorations out there. It begins with parts of the chart and Scales...
