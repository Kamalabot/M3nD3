        <h1>Smear the Data</h1>
        <p>Power of D3 lies in creating and positioning the SVG elements like Circles, rectangles and paths. Select, Join, Merge, Enter, Exit
            and Update are the methods that draw the data on html page from the data. These methods allow the creativity of the individual 
            to show.  
        </p>
        <p>
           Visualisation contains data, marks, scales, signals and channels. This page will contain only the marks. The marks are given 
           importance over the data. What these marks will show? Anything!!!, kind of Pixel Art with D3 and JS functions. Ready!!

            Challenges Circumvented!!
        </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating Data</li>
            <p>This page is about many different types of shapes that needs to be generated on the page automatically. There 
                will be Challenges in getting the shapes. I will document them, as I encounter in the JS itself. Some of the 
                shapes I am thinking of are 
                <ol>
                    <li>Slanting line from Left to Right downwards</li>
                    <li>Slanting line from Left to Right downwards</li>
                    <li>Stair Case</li>
                    <li>Concentric Circles</li>
                    <li>Cross hair</li>
                </ol> 
            </p>
            <li>Creating multiple shapes in same SVG</li>
            <p>I had started by complicating the data by categorising into Circle, lines, curves so on..
                D3 thinks all points same, it doesn't know which point belongs to which set of data. If I give it 
                a set of data, it will render it. array1.concat(array2) came to rescue where multiple lines or curves came
                into picture
            </p> 
            <li>Creating Circles</li>
            <p>Class tenth Geometry. x = radius * sin(angle) y = radius * cos(angle) 
                Concentric circles were simply concatenated together.</p>
            <li>Creating Stair Case</li>
            <p>It is multiple sets of straight horizontal and vertical lines. Learned how the Array concatenation along 
                with multiple loops works. </p>
            <li>Creating Cross Hair</li>
            <p>A bit more involved with maps and filters. Ideas is still concatenation of  
                the points that make the straight lines in the design. Some points will be omitted from the array.
            </p>
        </ul>
        <p>The show down is when the DOM is used to create transition between all these data points in single SVG using D3.</p>
