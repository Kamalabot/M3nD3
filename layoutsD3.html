        <h3>How to train on each of these layouts?</h3>
        <p> <strong>Option 1</strong> There are datasets available, which can be explored using the Vega extension in VScode.
            After the dataset can provide a good visual there, with any of the above layouts, then it 
            is programmed here.

            <strong>Option 2</strong> is to forget datasets, and create the data by myself using random numbers, or 
            manually. This option will give me freedom to train than importing the data.
            
            <strong>Option 3</strong> is to use the data that d3-gallery guys have used to explain these layouts. The chart I build will build 
            on the d3-gallery charts. 
        </p>
        <h3>How to layout the charts?</h3>
        <p> <strong>Option 1</strong> Since using the toy dataset, the charts are placed in g element and positioned on the top of page. The explanation and the 
            ideas explored will come at the bottom
            <strong>Option 2</strong> Use multiple SVGs to be created for each layout with the datasets chosen for it.
