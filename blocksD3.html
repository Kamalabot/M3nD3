    <h1>Bringing the Blocks to Life</h1>

    <p>Blockbuilder was an in-browser code editor that expanded into a data visualization search engine
        that hosted rich dataset and visualisation of over 40,000 examples.They were indexed by the 
        project over 5 years. Thanks to Ian for sharing the details of the files and the associated
    json stored in cloud over <a href="https://observablehq.com/@enjalot/blockbuilder-search-data">this</a>notebook
    at observablehq</p>

    <h2>Why bring the Blocks to life?</h2>
    <p>The visualisation with D3 has history of 10 years, and before that it was Protovis. What we see today is observablehq.
        Observablehq is an awesome tool. For new learners of visualisation like us, who intend to understand what observable 
        is doing behind the scenes. I wanted to see the examples that <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/curran">Curran</a>
        and <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock">Bostock</a> had created before Observablehq. These blocks were purely 
        interacting with the html document elements, and Javascript used was simple and straightforward    
    </p>
    <h2>Did you find the blocks using this Page?</h2>
    <p>Nope, I had browsed the blocks at <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/">bl.ocks.org</a> and learnt about the various introductory
    tutorial Bostock had created. After that I came across the following files that has all the blocks that were created by 
    various industry veterans for the past 10 years</p>

    </ul>
    <h2>What can I do with the above files?</h2>
    <p>Play with it. The files are having live data inside it which can be populated on to the html page using Jquery, 
        Javascript and D3. I have populated some parts of the data below. Think about some interesting ways to populate the 
        data in the html page. Or use the Ian's notebook as starting point and do some different analysis. Then port that 
        analysis to regular html page.
